# Bootstrap 3 UI

Transparently use [Bootstrap 3][twbs3] with [CakePHP 3][cakephp].

## Allow usage of bootstrap 3 and 4 in the same project

This repository is in sync with FriendsOfCake/bootstrap-ui 1.x releases and uses another namespace to allow installation of this package for bootstrap 3 and FriendsOfCake/bootstrap-ui 2.x for bootstrap 4 in the same project. 

```
composer require jorisvaesen/bootstrap-3-ui
composer require friendsofcake/bootstrap-ui:2.0.0-beta4
```

[cakephp]:http://cakephp.org
[twbs3]:http://getbootstrap.com
